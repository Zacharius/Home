* Home
  My attempt at a DAP(Distributed Autonomous Property). 

  The idea is to create a system in which multiple people can live in, own,
  maintain, and collectively make decisions about a house, building, or peice of
  property. 

  In this paradigm the dichtomy between renter and landlord is
  absolved. Instead, the people who currently live in a Home will be slowly
  buying shares of it from those who previously lived in it. This will ensure
  that everyone involved with the Home will be invested in its' long term
  health and will benefit from increasing property values.
  
  See spec.org for more specific details.
